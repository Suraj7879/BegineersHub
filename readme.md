# BegineersHub

-- Problem statement was the part of a hackathon conducted by BlueLearn.

-- BegineersHub curate the best of best updated resources for beginners to learn a particular skill in shortest, complete and most optimal way.

## Aboout the Project

-- Problem Chose -- Where to start

-- As a person had decided which skill he/she wants to learn, we have to come up with the Begineers resosurces so that the person not get lost on this huge web in the quest of the best, personalized and easily available course

-- As all the resources are available on the web, so instead of creating our own courses, I have planned to curate the best of best updated resources for begineers to learn a particular skill in shortest, complete and most optimal way.

-- How i will do this? Will take help from commmunity people, if someone came across some helpful content which he thinks would be good for begineer, then he/she should consider sharing it.

-- Why should begineer trust us ? 1. We are not creating new courses or content, we are sharing the best resources which already been shared by someone else, saving their tons of time.

-- Whats the need of it? Begineers often get lost, the content the social plaforms algorithms wont suggest old posts that often doesnt matter how valuable it is. And I am afraid beggineers might get distracted and end up consuming useless content, resulting in wasting a lot of time searching for resources.
